# ProjectOne - Beyond The Concert
## Concept                                         A web application where users search for their artist and it will display artist name, a cover art thumbnail and song? And then at the bottom we have a top 5 most popular songs in the US from Shazam.

## Motivation for Development           
The purpose of this project is to help users discover new music from their favorite artist.  

## User Story                                        
As a Concert goer, I WANT to search for new music release , SO THAT I can listen to my favourite artist.
