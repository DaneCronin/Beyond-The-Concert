#Beyond The Concert

## Concept                                        
A web application where users can search for their favorite artist and it will display the artist name, a cover art thumbnail and song. There are also the top 5 most popular songs in the US from Shazam being displayed.

## Motivation for Development           
The purpose of this project is to help users discover new music from their favorite artist.  

## User Story                                        
As a Concert goer, I WANT to search for upcoming shows that I may be interested in, SO THAT I can listen to my favourite artist.
